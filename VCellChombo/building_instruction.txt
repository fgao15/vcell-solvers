---SVN checkout(put the following folders under one directory and at the same level)
. vcell/trunk/Chombo
. vcell/trunk/numerics
. vcell/trunk/numerics/VCellChombo

--- Chomobo
. to set HDF5 flag when compiling Chombo, in Make.defs.local, we add "-DH5_USE_16_API" to HDFINCLFAGS and HDFMPIINCFLAGS (ignore if not doing MPI) 
 (* it also can be compiled with the flag "--with-default-api-version=v16" and then no additional flags are needed to compile Chombo*)
. open shell command or cygwin terminal
. cd Chombo/lib
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.debug.2D mk/Make.defs.local
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 2D debug libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.release.2D mk/Make.defs.local
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 2D release libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.debug.3D mk/Make.defs.local
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 3D debug libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.release.3D mk/Make.defs.local
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 3D release libs)
(only need to build what you need, for example, in cygwin, build 2D and 3D debug libs,
on cluster, build 2D and 3D release libs)

--- numerics (only for cygwin, otherwise on cluster build it normal way)
. open cygwin terminal
. cd numerics, mkdir cmake-build-cygwin
. cd cmake-build-cygwin
. cmake -i .. (first time)
. change TARGET_CHOMBO_CYGWIN_BUILD to ON (when choose this, TARGET_SOLVER_WITH_MESSAGING, TARGET_SOLVER_NO_MESSAGING should be all OFF)
. cmake -i .. (second time)
. make (build expression parser, hdf5 and unzip, zip only)
. make install
(this puts hdf5 in cmake-build-cygwin/lib and other three in cmake-build-cygwin/bin)

-- VCellChombo
. after checkout, it should be a NetBeans project.
. right click, click "Build Project" (this exe is saved at /dist Debug_2D(/3D/Release_2D/3D)/Cygwin_4.x-Windows
