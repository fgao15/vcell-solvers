---SVN checkout(put the following folders under one directory and at the same level)
. vcell/trunk/Chombo
. vcell/trunk/numerics
. vcell/trunk/numerics/VCellChombo

--- Chomobo
note 1. to set HDF5 flag when compiling Chombo, in Make.defs.local, we add "-DH5_USE_16_API" to HDFINCLFAGS and HDFMPIINCFLAGS (ignore if not doing MPI) 
 (* it also can be compiled with the flag "--with-default-api-version=v16" and then no additional flags are needed to compile Chombo*)
note 2. when building Chombo in cygwin, HUGE has to be changed to HUGE_VAL in ConstrainedLS.cpp (4 matches) and LSProblemImplem.H (3 matches). The change
is not needed when building on Linux server.

. open shell command or cygwin terminal
. cd Chombo/lib
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.debug.2D mk/Make.defs.local (open the file, choose the proper hdf5 flags)
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 2D debug libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.release.2D mk/Make.defs.local (open the file, choose the proper hdf5 flags)
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 2D release libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.debug.3D mk/Make.defs.local (open the file, choose the proper hdf5 flags)
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 3D debug libs)
. cp mk/Make.defs.local.release.3D mk/Make.defs.local (open the file, choose the proper hdf5 flags)
. make lib USE_MF=TRUE (this will build 3D release libs)
(only need to build what you need, for example, in cygwin, build 2D and 3D debug libs,
on cluster, build 2D and 3D release libs)

--- numerics (only for cygwin, otherwise on cluster build it normal way)
. open cygwin terminal
. cd numerics, mkdir cmake-build-cygwin
. cd cmake-build-cygwin
. cmake -i .. (first time)
. change TARGET_CHOMBO_CYGWIN_BUILD to ON (when choose this, TARGET_SOLVER_WITH_MESSAGING, TARGET_SOLVER_NO_MESSAGING should be all OFF)
. cmake -i .. (second time)
. make (build expression parser, hdf5 and unzip, zip only)
. make install
(this puts hdf5 in cmake-build-cygwin/lib and other three in cmake-build-cygwin/bin)

-- VCellChombo
. after checkout, it should be a NetBeans project.
. right click, click "Build Project" (this exe is saved at /dist Debug_2D(/3D/Release_2D/3D)/Cygwin_4.x-Windows

*******building on cluster for VCell C/S mode, read this
(building order: numerics(without VCellChombo), then Chombo libs and at the last VCellChombo(which has to go with building of numerics again)
"check" command under original Chombo is not executable, remember to make it executable and then start building Chombo libs.
In addition, to build Chombo libs, we have to have numerics built and installed first. so that Chombo can reference HDF5 libs and included h files.

If you checkout a fresh numerics, you have to go to CMakeList to comment the VCellChombo and do make install first.
Then uncomment VCellChombo and do make install.
