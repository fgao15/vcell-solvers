QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2005
QTDIR=C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.3\msvc2005

1. in plotui, either add QWT_DLL 
or when building qwt 5.2.1, default build is dll, so in qwtconfig.pri, comment out the following
#CONFIG           += QwtDll

2. i have to replace QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.3\msvc2005\bin with Qt\2010.05\qt\bin 
	uic3.exe in QtSDK doesnot work 
	lib in Qt doesnot work
	
	but when you run it, you need to revert it back.
3. copasi\blaswrap.h, the following lines are commented because we use CLAPACK.
//# ifdef USE_CLAPACK
//#  define daxpy_ f2c_daxpy
//#  define dcopy_ f2c_dcopy
//#  define ddot_ f2c_ddot
//#  define dgemm_ f2c_dgemm
//#  define dnrm2_ f2c_dnrm2
//#  define dscal_ f2c_dscal
//#  define idamax_ f2c_idamax
//# endif
4 raptor windows_config.h, have to define the following.
	#define index(a,b) strchr(a,b)
	#define rindex(a,b) strrchr(a,b)
because on windows there are no index or rindex (old functions).

5. since LIBSBML_STATIC is defined as one of proprocessors, i have to recompile libsbml as a static lib, not dll.

6. same thing with expat and raptor, libxml2 etc, Qwt, QwtPlot3d, build .lib, not .dll, so that final executable only has dependancies on Qt.
