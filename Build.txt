to build on any machine:

1) install VirtualBox
2) install Vagrant

>> mkdir build
>> cd build
>> svn co svn://code3.cam.uchc.edu/vcell/trunk/numerics
>> git clone https://github.com/vcelljim/vcell-numerics-build.git
>> cd vcell-numerics-build

#
# cd to the directory of the machine to run 
#   - Windows Clients work best on Windows Hosts (needs powershell on host ... vagrant ps)
#   - MacOS Clients only work on MacOS (due to licensing)
#   - Linux Clients work on any machine (needs an ssh client on the host)
#
>> cd linux64-server  (vagrant commands must be run from within the "vagrant" directory for each machine)
>> vagrant up
>> more README.md ... for directions specific to that environment
>> vagrant ssh -c build.sh

vagrant machines have drive mappings (see <vagrant_dir>/Vagrantfile for details)

for interactive login:

>> vagrant ssh
or
>> vagrant ps (on windows host and client)
