 * @class Delay
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's Delay construct for Event.
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
 * are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
 * effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
 * the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
 * object of class Delay.
 *
 * The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
 * subelement called "math".  This subelement is used to hold MathML
 * content.  The mathematical formula represented by "math" must evaluate
 * to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when the
 * event has @em fired and when the event's assignments are actually @em
 * executed.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time delay of zero
 * is assumed.
 *
 * The expression in "math" must be evaluated at the time the rule is @em
 * fired.  The expression must always evaluate to a positive number
 * (otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is
 * defined to fire before it is triggered!).
 *
 * @section delay-units The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay
 *
 * The units of the numerical value computed by the Delay's "math"
 * expression must be units of time.  Note that <em>units are not
 * predefined or assumed</em> for the contents of "math" in a Delay object;
 * rather, they must be defined explicitly for each instance of a Delay
 * object in a model.  This is an important point to bear in mind when pure
 * numbers are used in delay expressions.  For example, the following Event
 * instance would fail model validation: the expression inside the "math"
 * element does not have any declared units, and what is required in this
 * context is units of time:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfEvents>
 *         <event>
 *             ...
 *             <delay>
 *                 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *                     <cn> 1 </cn>
 *                 </math>
 *             </delay>
 *             ...
 *         </event>
 *     </listOfEvents>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The <tt>&lt;cn&gt; 1 &lt;/cn&gt;</tt> within the mathematical formula of the
 * @c delay above has <em>no units declared</em>.  To make the expression
 * have the needed units of time, we must use one of the techniques
 * discussed in the SBML Level 2 Version 3 specification, namely, either
 * defining a parameter for the number and using it in place of the number,
 * or else multiplying the number with a parameter having the proper units.
 * Here we employ the second approach as an illustration:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfParameters>
 *         <parameter id="TimeUnits" value="1" units="time"/>
 *     </listOfParameters>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfEvents>
 *         <event>
 *             ...
 *             <delay>
 *                 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *                     <apply>
 *                         <times/>
 *                         <cn> 1 </cn>
 *                         <ci> TimeUnits </ci>
 *                     </apply>
 *                 </math>
 *             </delay>
 *             ...
 *         </event>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
