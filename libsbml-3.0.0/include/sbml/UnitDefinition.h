 * @class UnitDefinition
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's UnitDefinition construct.
 *
 * Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an %SBML
 * model.  The units of the following mathematical entities can be
 * specified explicitly: the size of a compartment, the initial amount of a
 * species, and the units of constant and variable parameter values.  The
 * overall units of any mathematical formula appearing in %SBML are those
 * that arise naturally from the components and mathematical expressions
 * comprising the formula, or in other words, the units obtained by doing
 * dimensional analysis on the formula.
 *
 * Rather than requiring a complete unit definition on every construct,
 * %SBML provides a facility for defining units that can be referenced
 * throughout a model.  In addition, every kind of %SBML mathematical
 * entity has units assigned to it from a set of built-in defaults (listed
 * below); by redefining these built-in default units, it is possible to
 * change the units used throughout a model in a simple and consistent
 * manner.
 * 
 * The %SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
 * UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in %SBML is
 * compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
 * constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
 * another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
 * The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
 * assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
 * identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
 * UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
 * inside UnitDefinition instances.
 *
 * @section unitdef-summary Summary of the UnitDefinition construct
 *
 * UnitDefinition in SBML Level 2 Version 3 has two attributes and one
 * subelement.  The two attributes are "id" and "name", and the subelement
 * is ListOfUnits.
 *
 * The required attribute "id" and optional attribute "name" are both
 * strings.  The "id" attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique
 * identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to
 * it.  The "name" attribute is intended to be used for giving the unit
 * definition an optional human-readable name.
 *
 * There are two important restrictions about the use of unit definition
 * "id" values:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The "id" of a UnitDefinition must @em not contain a value from the
 *   list of reserved base unit names (i.e., the strings @c gram, @c liter,
 *   etc.; see the definition of Unit for the complete list).  This
 *   constraint simply prevents the redefinition of the base units.
 *
 * <li> There is a set of predefined identifiers for the built-in default
 *   units in SBML; these identifiers are @c substance, @c volume, @c area,
 *   @c length, and @c time.  Using one of these values for the attribute
 *   "id" of a UnitDefinition has the effect of redefining the model-wide
 *   default units for the corresponding quantities.  The list of
 *   built-in units is given in the table below:
 *   @image html built-in-units.jpg "SBML's built-in units"
 *   @image latex built-in-units.jpg "SBML's built-in units"
 *   Two limitations are imposed on redefining the built-in units:
 *   (1) The UnitDefinition of a redefined built-in unit can only
 *      contain a single Unit object within it.
 *   (2) The value of the "kind" attribute in 
 *      a Unit instance must be drawn from one of the values
 *      in the second column of the table above.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A UnitDefinition must contain exactly one ListOfUnits, and this list
 * must contain one or more Unit definitions; see the definitions of these
 * other object classes for more information about them.  The following
 * example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written in XML)
 * when they all the pieces are combined together.  This defines "mmls"
 * to be millimoles per litre per second.
 * @code
 * <listOfUnitDefinitions>
 *     <unitDefinition id="mmls">
 *         <listOfUnits>
 *             <unit kind="mole"   scale="-3"/>
 *             <unit kind="litre"  exponent="-1"/>
 *             <unit kind="second" exponent="-1"/>
 *         </listOfUnits>
 *     </unitDefinition>
 * </listOfUnitDefinitions>
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section sbml-units-limits Further comments about SBML's unit definition system
 * 
 * The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new %SBML unit
 * definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
 * factors.  An example of this might be <em>moles per litre per
 * second</em>.  What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit definitions
 * from more complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of
 * an additive offset from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates
 * all unit definition systems, yet in the domain of %SBML the real-life
 * cases requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our
 * knowledge, only involve temperature).  Consequently, the %SBML unit
 * system has been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify
 * implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems
 * biology.
 *
 * As of %SBML Level 2 Version 2, Unit no longer has the attribute called
 * "offset" introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 1.  It turned out that the
 * general case involving units with offsets was incorrectly defined, and
 * few (if any) developers even attempted to support offset-based units in
 * their software.  In the development of Level 2 Version 2, a consensus
 * among %SBML developers emerged that a fully generalized unit scheme is
 * @em so confusing and complicated that it actually @em impedes
 * interoperability.  SBML Level 2 Version 2 and Version 3 acknowledge this
 * reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system, specifically by
 * removing the "offset" attribute on Unit and @c Celsius as a pre-defined
 * unit.
 *
 * The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do
 * require the use of zero offsets for their definitions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Handling Celsius</em>.  A model in which certain quantities are
 *   temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted
 *   straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in
 *   kelvin.  A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward
 *   substitution using the following relationship: T<sub> kelvin</sub> =
 *   T<sub> Celsius</sub> + 273.15.  In every mathematical formula of the
 *   model where a quantity (call it @em x) in degrees Celsius appears,
 *   replace @em x with x<sub> k</sub>+ 273.15, where x<sub> k</sub> is now
 *   in kelvin.  An alternative approach would be to use a
 *   FunctionDefinition to define a function encapsulating this
 *   relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as
 *   needed.  Since Celsius is a commonly-used unit, software tools could
 *   help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures
 *   in Celsius in the tools' interfaces, and making substitutions
 *   automatically when writing out the SBML.
 *
 * <li> <em>Other units requiring offsets</em>.  One approach to handling
 *   other kinds of units is to use a FunctionDefinition to define a function
 *   encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then
 *   substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity
 *   appeared in the model.  For example, here is a possible definition for
 *   converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees:
 *   @code
 * <functionDefinition id="Fahrenheit_to_kelvin">
 *     <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *         <lambda>
 *             <bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
 *             <apply>
 *                 <divide/>
 *                 <apply>
 *                     <plus/>
 *                     <ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
 *                     <cn> 459.67 </cn>
 *                 </apply>
 *                 <cn> 1.8 </cn>
 *             </apply>
 *         </lambda>
 *     </math>
 * </functionDefinition>
 *   @endcode
 *     
 * <li> An alternative approach not requiring the use of function definitions
 *   is to use an AssignmentRule for each variable in Fahrenheit units.
 *   The AssignmentRule could compute the conversion from Fahrenheit to
 *   (say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin units), and
 *   then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.
 *
 * <li> Still another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a
 *   model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the
 *   original quantity appeared.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Please consult the SBML specifications for more information about this
 * and other issues involving units.

/**
 * @class ListOfUnitDefinitions
 * @brief Container class for lists of UnitDefinition objects in a Model.
 * 
 * The various ListOf___ classes in %SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an %SBML model.  All are derived from
 * the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
 * subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
 * ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
 *
 * The relationship between the lists and the rest of an %SBML model is
 * illustrated by the following (for %SBML Level 2 Version 3):
 *
 * @image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 * @image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 *
 * Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
 * containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
 * all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
 * to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
 * in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
 * visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
 * the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
 * can add information about the lists themselves into each list
 * container's "annotation".
 *
 * @see ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
 * ListOfCompartmentTypes, ListOfSpeciesTypes, ListOfCompartments,
 * ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
 * ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.
