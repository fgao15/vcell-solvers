 * @class EventAssignment
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's EventAssignment construct for Event
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
 * affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The purpose
 * of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables are
 * affected by an Event.  In every instance of an Event definition in a
 * model, the object's ListOfEventAssignments must have a non-empty list of
 * one or more elements of class EventAssignment.
 *
 * The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
 * whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is @em fired, and
 * the other when the event is @em executed.  EventAssignment objects are
 * interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described below.
 * 
 * EventAssignment is derived from SBase and adds one attribute
 * ("variable") and one subelement ("math", containing MathML content).
 * The attribute "variable" is required to have a value.  Its type is the
 * SBML type @c SId and can contain the identifier of an existing
 * Compartment, Species or (global) Parameter instance defined in the
 * model.
 *
 * @section event-variable Effects of event assignments
 * 
 * An SBML event assignment has effect when the event is @em executed; that
 * is, at the end of any given delay period (if defined) following the
 * moment that the Event is triggered.  When the event fires, the effect is
 * to change the value of the model component identified by the "variable"
 * attribute.  Specifically, the component's value (which may be a species'
 * quantity, compartment's size or parameter's value) is instantaneously
 * reset to the value computed by the "math" subelement of the
 * EventAssignment.
 * 
 * Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in "variable":
 * <ul>
 * <li> The object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
 * "variable" must not have its "constant" attribute set to or default to
 * @c true.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)
 *
 * <li> The "variable" attribute must not contain the identifier of a
 * reaction; only species, compartment and parameter values may be set by
 * an Event.
 *
 * <li> The value of every "variable" attribute must be unique among the set
 * of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In other
 * words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment objects
 * assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed at the
 * same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
 * indeterminacy.)  However, @em separate Event instances can refer to the
 * same variable.
 *  
 * <li> A variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
 * instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
 * value of an EventAssignment's "variable" attribute cannot be the same as
 * the value of a AssignmentRule' "variable" attribute.  (Assignment rules
 * hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an
 * event that reassigns the value of the same variable.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section event-math The "math" subelement in an EventAssignment
 * 
 * The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
 * value of the variable being assigned by the Event.  This expression is
 * evaluated when the Event is @em fired, but the variable only acquires
 * the result or new value when the Event is actually @em executed.  The
 * order of the EventAssignment structures is not significant; the effect
 * of one assignment cannot affect the result of another assignment.  The
 * identifiers occurring in the MathML @c ci attributes of the
 * EventAssignment structures represent the value of the identifier at the
 * point when the Event is @em fired.
 * 
 * In all cases, as would be expected, the units of the formula in an
 * EventAssignment must be consistent with the units of the object
 * identified by the @c variable attribute.  More precisely:
 * <ul>
 * <li> In the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
 * species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value
 * determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's "math" subelement.
 * The units of the "math" formula must be identical to the units of the
 * species.
 *
 * <li> In the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
 * compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in the "math"
 * subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the formula
 * must be identical to the units specified for the size of the compartment
 * identified by the EventAssignment's "variable" attribute.
 *
 * <li> In the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
 * parameter's value to that determined by the formula in "math".  The
 * overall units of the formula must be identical to the units defined for
 * the parameter
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that the formula placed in the "math" element <em>has no assumed
 * units</em>.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units
 * of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly
 * established just as in the case of the value of the Delay subelement.
 * An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of Delay may be
 * used for the formula of an EventAssignment.
 *
 * @section event-semantics Semantics of Event and EventAssignment
 *
 * Readers are urged to consult the SBML specification for important
 * information about the interpretation of Event and EventAssignment.
 *
 *
 * @class ListOfEventAssignments 
 * @brief Container class for lists of EventAssignment objects in an Event.
 *
 * The various ListOf___ classes in %SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an %SBML model.  All are derived from
 * the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
 * subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
 * ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
 *
 * ListOfEventAssignments is entirely contained within Event.
